After removing the Led digit displays  the sdram_test.bin
appeared to fail since all 4 leds did not light up.
A diff of sdram_test.py revealed  several led_status.next 
lines had been commented out by mistake.  Re-running 
created a new sdram_test.v and bin file that worked as the 
the one that included the led digit displays.
